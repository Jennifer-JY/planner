The calendar now displays the days in the selected month.
=> Future improvement: to put the days on the sixth rows of the days
in the next month so that users do not miss the days that they have to 
scroll down to see.

Plan:
seed the database for the todo item
in the formAction, we calculate the days we are gonna display, with the 
todo details that are stored in the database. So in the for loop where
we generate the dates, we can just put the corresponding todo item with
the dates

Then learn the next js again for the params. Adding actions for the editor page
to create new todos and edite the existing todos.

Add error and not found pages
