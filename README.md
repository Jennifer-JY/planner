# Planview

_This project is a work-in-progress. I’m continuously learning and improving it_

## Description

PlanView is a calendar app inspired by the way I plan my own life. It provides a clean month overview and lets users click on individual dates to edit their daily content.

- 🔐 Users can register and log in to manage their own calendars.

- 📝 The text editor is built with Tiptap, supporting:

  - Rich text formatting: bold, italic, and different font families

  - Text highlighting and custom colours for better visual organisation

This project focuses on simplicity, clarity, and real-world usability.

## 📝 Usage Tips

- Click on a date to open the editor.
- Add your to-do items and click Save to store them.
- Return to the date to view your saved content.

**Note:**

- You must be logged in to save and view your data.
- Each user has a separate calendar.
- You can register with any email address (e.g., fake@example.com). No real email or verification is required.
